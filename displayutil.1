.SH DESCRIPTION
displayutil is a command line utility for retrieving information

information about active displays.
.SH MODES & OPTIONS

.TP
.B brightness|br [all|main|display id [0.0 - 1.0]]

If the 'all' option is specified, lists the brightness setting of all 
active displays.  

If the 'main' option is specified, lists the brightness setting of the
main display.  

If a 'display id' is specified, the brightness setting of the specified
display, if available, is listed. If a value between 0.0 and 1.0 is 
provided after a display id, if possible, the brightness of that display
is set to the specified value.
.TP
.B darkmode|dm [enable|disable|on|off]

Prints the current darkmode setting (on/off) if no options are specified.

The 'enable' or 'on' options enable darkmode.

The 'disable' or 'off' options disable darkmode.
.TP
.B grayscale|gs [enable|disable|on|off]

Prints the current grayscale setting (on/off) if no options are specified.

The 'enable' or 'on' options enable grayscale mode.

The 'disable' or 'off' options disable grayscale mode.
.TP
.B ls|list [-v|-e] [all|main|display id]

Lists information about all active displays if no options are specified,
or if the 'all' option is specified. If the 'main' option is specified, 
information about the main display is listed.  If a 'display id' is 
specified, information about the specified display, if available, is
listed.  

Additional information is shown if the -v (verbose) or -e (extended) 
options are specified.  The -v (verbose) option only shows information 
for supported display resolutions, whereas the -e (extended) option 
shows information for all available display resolutions.
.TP
.B nightshift|ns [enable|disable|on|off]
       [schedule [disable|sunset|[h]h:mm [h]h:mm]]
       [0.0 - 1.0]
                 
Prints the current nightshift setting (on/off), its schedule and strength if
no options are specified.

The 'enable' or 'on' options enable nightshift mode.  If nightshift's
strength is set to 0, these options will set nightshift's strength to 1.0
(full strength).

The 'off' option turns off nightshift mode.

The 'disable' option turns nightshift mode off and sets its strength to 0.0.

If the 'schedule' option is specified without any additional arguments, the
current nightshift schedule (if any) is displayed.

If the 'schedule' option is specified with the 'disable' argument, the 
nightshift schedule (if any) is disabled.

If the 'schedule' option is specified with the 'sunset' argument, nightshift
is enabled from sunet to sunrise.

If the 'schedule' option is specified with two arguments of the form 
"[hour]:[min]", nightshift is enabled from the time specified by first argument
to the time specified by the second argument.  

If a value between 0.0 and 1.0 is specified instead of one of the above
options, the nightshift strength is set to that value and, if nightshift was
disabled, nightshift is enabled.
