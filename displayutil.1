Available on MacOS 10.14 (Mojave).

.B nightshift|ns [enable|disable|on|off]
       [schedule [sunset|disable]]
       [0.0 - 1.0]
                 
Displays the current nightshift setting (on/off) and its strength if
no options are specified.

The 'enable' or 'on' options enable nightshift mode.  If nightshift's
strength is set to 0, these options will set nightshift's strength to 1.0
(full strength).

The 'off' option turns off nightshift mode.

The 'disable' option turns nightshift mode off and sets its strength to 0.0.

If the 'schedule' option is specified, 'sunset' enables nightshift from sunet
to sunrise, while 'disable' disables any nightshift schedule.

If a value between 0.0 and 1.0 is specified instead of one of the above
options, the nightshift strength is set to that value and enabled.
